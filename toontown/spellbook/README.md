# The Toontown Offline Magic Word Manager

An open-sourced, modern Magic Word Manager for Toontown

Benefits to Toontown Online's Magic Word Manager:

Everything. Anything is better than a load of elifs
Benefits to Toontown Rewritten's "publicly" sourced Magic Word Manager:

Aliases, meaning you can execute a Magic Word with multiple different terms
Sthickerbook compatibility (descriptions, automatic examples, a couple other things)
All Magic Words are to be gathered in one place as opposed to spread out among many files
Improved targeting, so you can target more than just yourself or another Toon (everyone in the zone, everyone on the server, and more)
More sanity checks, woohoo!
This one is open-source, so you aren't stealing any code
Feel free to use it in any project you wish so long as credit is given to all contributors:
